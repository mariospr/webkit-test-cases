        This test shows a problem happening when AC is enabled AND we have 3 animations
        where 2 of them happen SIMULTANEOUSLY and a 3rd one starts EXACTLY when the other
        2 animations finish:
      </p>
      <p>
        The WEBVIEW seems to FLICKER for a split second when the third animation starts,
        showing it COMPLETELY RENDERED with the same colour of the #visible-bg DIV
        element's background.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, it also seems to be relevant for the glitch to happen that the
        two initial animations start with a certain delay (no delay won't cause the glitch)
        AND that the #testDiv style defines both <em>overflow: hidden</em> and
        <em>animation-fill-mode = forwards</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last, it also seems to be relevant that the first two DIVS use ABSOLUTE (or fixed)
        positioning, and that the GREEN background rendered by #visible-bg is drawn right on
        top of of some text, as positioning the green background so that it does not cover any
        text does not cause the glitch either.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE</b>: This does NOT happen EVERY TIME, but quite often instead, meaning that you
        might NEED TO REFRESH your webview a few times before actually seeing the glitch.
